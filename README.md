# ‚≠êÔ∏è PromptShield: The Jedi Firewall for AI Prompts

> ‚ÄúMay the prompt be with you.‚Äù

PromptShield is a Star Wars-inspired, AI-powered firewall for Large Language Model (LLM) prompts. It analyzes, classifies, and defends against prompt injection and risky prompt patterns, providing real-time analysis, threat detection, and actionable insights to help users and developers maintain safe and ethical AI interactions.

## 1. üåå What is PromptShield?

PromptShield is your Jedi guardian in the galaxy of AI. It stands between your LLM-powered app and the dark side of prompt injection, jailbreaks, and unsafe user input. With real-time analysis, Jedi/Sith theming, and actionable insights, PromptShield helps you keep your AI safe, responsible, and fun.

## 2. üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Used (and Why)

### Backend
- **Python (Flask):** Simple, fast, and perfect for rapid prototyping REST APIs.
- **LangChain & LangChain-Together:** For LLM orchestration and integration with Together AI (Meta Llama-3 model).
- **ChromaDB:** Persistent vector database for storing and semantically matching custom security flags.
- **Sentence Transformers:** For robust semantic similarity between prompts and red flags.
- **python-dotenv:** Securely loads API keys and secrets from environment variables.

### Frontend
- **HTML, CSS (custom + Tailwind), JavaScript:** For a responsive, interactive, and highly themed UI.
- **Chart.js:** For analytics and data visualization.
- **Web Speech API:** Enables voice input for prompts.
- **Star Wars assets:** Custom fonts, images, and backgrounds for immersive theming.

**Why?**  
The stack is chosen for rapid development, advanced LLM features, and a unique, immersive user experience.

## 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è The Problem We're Solving

Prompt injection and unsafe prompt patterns are a growing threat in LLM-powered applications. Attackers can manipulate AI behavior, leak sensitive data, or bypass safety controls. PromptShield:
- Detects and blocks risky prompts (the "Sith")
- Suggests safe rewrites (the "Jedi" way)
- Provides analytics and insights to help you monitor and improve your AI security
- Lets you add custom security flags, with semantic deduplication

---

## 5. üí° Business Model (if applicable)

PromptShield is open source and free for the community. For commercial use, it could be offered as:
- A managed API service for LLM prompt security
- A plug-and-play security layer for enterprise AI apps
- Custom consulting and integration for large organizations
